# Stend_SES

The project is an experimental stand for the study of output voltage ripples of different topologies of DC/DC converters (**classical**, **two-phase** and **stacked interleaved buck converter**).


There was:
   + an electrical circuit has been developed,
   + a printed circuit board is created,
   + installation of components was carried out,
   + written software for STM32,
   + debugged work.
